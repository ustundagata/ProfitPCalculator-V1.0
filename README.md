# ProfitPCalculator

<p> Imagine doing what you like the most, for example computer repairing. Well that's what I like and I know there are many other poeple who likes repairing the computers and then selling them. Even though repairing steps is fun it is not fun to calculate everything on a peace of paper. You may lose the paper or an accident may occur. So I developed ProfitPCalculator to help people like me to calculate how much it will cost to repair that pc you found and how much can you make after the sales tax in your state.</p>
